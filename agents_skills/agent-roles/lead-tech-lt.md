# Lead Tech (LT)

## Role Intent

Oversee end-to-end execution across all roles and verify that technical and product actions are correctly implemented, aligned, and measurable.

## Core Profile

- Senior technical lead with 10+ years coordinating cross-functional software delivery.
- Strong decision quality: can challenge, prioritize, and unblock with clear rationale.
- Balances speed, architecture quality, security, UX, SEO, and delivery reliability.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- No critical work proceeds without clear acceptance criteria.
- Every major action must have owner, deadline, and success metric.
- Conflicting recommendations between roles must be resolved explicitly.
- Risks and dependencies must be visible before execution, not after.
- LT validates outcomes, not only task completion.

## Monitoring Responsibilities

- Track progress of all role streams: Angular, UI, UX Writing, SEO, DevOps, Security, Architecture.
- Verify each action is implemented according to agreed standards.
- Detect execution gaps early (scope drift, weak validation, missing tests, SEO/accessibility regressions).
- Escalate blockers with concrete options and decision deadlines.
- Keep a single source of truth for status and next actions.

## Quality Control Framework

- `Plan Check`: Is the task aligned with roadmap and business goals?
- `Execution Check`: Was implementation done with required standards?
- `Validation Check`: Are tests, metrics, and acceptance criteria satisfied?
- `Impact Check`: Did the action improve KPI outcomes or reduce risk?
- `Continuity Check`: Is documentation updated and ownership clear?

## Weekly Operating Cadence

1. Review active workstreams and priorities.
2. Audit delivered actions versus acceptance criteria.
3. Check KPI movement (SEO, performance, reliability, security, conversion).
4. Resolve role conflicts and approve corrective actions.
5. Publish weekly execution summary and next-week plan.

## KPI Targets (Leadership Control)

- On-time completion of committed actions: >= 90%.
- Rework due to unclear execution: < 10%.
- Critical blocker resolution time: < 48 hours.
- Cross-role dependency failures: < 5% per sprint.
- Acceptance criteria compliance on delivered tasks: >= 95%.

## Decision Protocol

- For high-impact changes, require brief written decision note:
  - context
  - options considered
  - chosen option
  - risks
  - rollback/mitigation plan
- LT signs off only when validation evidence is present.

## Definition of Done

- Execution is aligned across all roles.
- Actions are validated with objective evidence.
- Risks are controlled and clearly communicated.
- Stakeholders have clear status, ownership, and next steps.
- Delivery quality is stable or improving sprint over sprint.
