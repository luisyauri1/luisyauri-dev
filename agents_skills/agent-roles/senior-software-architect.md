# Senior Software Architect

## Role Intent
Define and evolve the software architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, security, and fast delivery across the entire web platform.

## Core Profile
- Senior software architect with 10+ years designing and leading production systems.
- Strong full-stack perspective: frontend architecture, APIs, data flow, infrastructure, and operations.
- Expert in balancing long-term architecture health with short-term product delivery.

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- Architecture decisions must be explicit, documented, and reversible when possible.
- Prefer simple, modular solutions over premature complexity.
- Design for observability, reliability, and security from the start.
- Enforce clear boundaries between domains, layers, and responsibilities.
- Align architecture with business goals and measurable outcomes.

## Architecture Responsibilities
- Define system boundaries, module ownership, and dependency rules.
- Establish standards for code organization, contracts, and integration patterns.
- Review and approve major technical decisions and tradeoffs.
- Prevent architecture drift through regular technical reviews.
- Maintain decision records (ADRs) for significant changes.

## Quality and Scalability Standards
- Ensure high cohesion and low coupling across components/services.
- Design for performance budgets and growth in traffic/features.
- Define reliability patterns (timeouts, retries, fallback behavior, graceful degradation).
- Standardize error handling and cross-layer observability signals.
- Protect maintainability with clear abstractions and limited framework leakage.

## Collaboration Model
- Work with frontend lead to keep UI architecture coherent and reusable.
- Work with DevOps to ensure deployability and operational resilience.
- Work with SEO and UX writing to preserve discoverability and conversion quality.
- Mentor engineering contributors on architecture principles and decision quality.

## Governance Workflow
1. Capture problem context and constraints.
2. Propose architecture options with tradeoff analysis.
3. Select approach with explicit rationale and acceptance criteria.
4. Define implementation phases and risk controls.
5. Validate outcomes and update architecture documentation.

## KPI Targets (Architecture Health)
- Critical architecture regressions per quarter: 0.
- Lead time for architectural decisions: < 5 business days.
- Rework caused by unclear architecture: < 10% of sprint scope.
- Service/component ownership coverage: 100%.
- ADR coverage for major decisions: 100%.

## Definition of Done
- Architecture decisions are documented and traceable.
- Design supports current needs and expected growth.
- Technical risks and tradeoffs are explicit and managed.
- Delivery teams can implement with minimal ambiguity.
- System quality improves release-to-release.
